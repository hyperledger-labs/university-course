# Enterprise Blockchain Technologies
##A Hyperledger Fabric's v2.x University Course ðŸŽ“

<img src="./ebt.png" width="1000">

## At the end of this course I will:

1.  Understand theory on blockchain: what is it (<b>Lab 1, Lab2</b>), and which problems it can solve (<b>Lab 3</b>)
3. Know Hyperledeger Fabric's components in detail, as well as its architecture and transactional model (<b>Lab 4</b>)
4. Be able to write Hyperledger Fabric chaincode, and bootstrap a Hyperledger Fabric network running those contracts (<b>Lab 5</b>)
4. Provision a Hyperledger Fabric network, and to develop full-stack blockchain decentralized applications (<b>Lab 6</b>)
5. Understand advanced concepts on the area of consensus, using Hyperledger Umbra (<b>Lab 7, Lab 8</b>)

This course aims at providing a reliable basis for university students to get started into enterprise blockchain.
Currently, this course supports Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Umbra.

## Course Overview
This course contains the practical part of a university course on enterprise blockchain technologies.
Typically, a university course is divided into theory and laboratories. Theory explains the theoretical foundations behind what is learned on the Laboratories.
Currently, this course only contains the laboratory classes.

This course is suited to be a 7.5 ECTS master level course, that assumes 3 hours of theory per week + 1.5 hours of practice (1 Lab) per week.

## Course Organization

The course is divided into two modules:

* Module I introduces enterprise blockchain (labs 1-4)
* Module II focuses on Hyperledger Fabric (labs 5-8).

For universities using trimesters, the course can be separated into the two modules (1 per trimester).

For universities using semesters, the whole course (labs 1-9) can be taught in one semester.


## Folder organization
`docs` - contains rendered labs

`source` - contains the LaTeX sources for the labs

`support` - contains the support files for the labs

## Contribute

Your contributions are very welcome! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Contributions are not only code! You can help to improve this project in the following ways:
1. Extend the course to other enterprise blockchain technologies. This can be done by adding a new Module. Since this course is modular, universities and other learning institutions can build a customized course using a combination of the available modules.
Examples of Modules that would be desirable: Corda, Hyperledger Besu, Hyperledger Cactus, Hyperledger Sawtooth, Hyperledger Iroha, Cosmos, Polkadot, DAML.

2. Complete the current laboratories. Some improvement options are present on the [issues page](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/university-course/issues). For time limitations, some labs are not final (chaincode can be extended, the full stack application functionalities can be extended, their frontends as well). Contributions on finishing those would be welcome.

3. Help improve the design of the lab guides.

4. Maintaining and disseminating this project. Contributions to disseminate and manage this project are welcome. Please contact Rafael Belchior <rafael.belchior (at) tecnico (dot) ulisboa (dot) pt>.

5. Contribute with technical expertise in the form of small articles, such as this [introduction to the Libra Blockchain](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-libra-blockchain-technical-overview-part-i-5e872b0369c) or this [2020 review on blockchain interoperability](https://medium.com/coinmonks/blockchain-interoperability-in-2020-a-4-minute-review-e9589b1b1808). Such articles can be added to a special module, in which students read and discuss them.
