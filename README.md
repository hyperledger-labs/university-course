Welcome to Enterprise Blockchain Technologies, a **flexible, extensible, open-source course** üéì

This course aims at providing a reliable basis for university students to get started in enterprise blockchain.

This course contains the practical part of a university course on enterprise blockchain technologies.
Typically, a university course is divided into **theory** and **laboratory** classes. The theory explains the theoretical foundations behind what is learned in the laboratories.


## At the end of this course, you will:

‚úÖ Understand the theory on blockchain: what is it (<b>Lab 1, Lab2</b>), and which problems it can solve (<b>Lab 3</b>)

‚úÖ Get to know Hyperledger Fabric's components in detail, such as architecture and transactional model (<b>Lab 4</b>), chaincode (<b>Lab 5</b>), network, and how to develop an enterprise full-stack blockchain decentralized application (<b>Lab 6</b>)

‚úÖ Leverage Hyperledger Umbra to study advanced topics on Fabric (<b>Lab 7, Lab 8</b>)

## Course Organization

The course is divided into two modules:

* Module I introduces enterprise blockchain (labs 1-4)
* Module II focuses on Hyperledger Fabric (labs 5-8).

Each laboratory is assumed to take 1.5h, supported by a teaching assistant. All laboratories assume 3h of theory classes. Thus, this course could be organized as a 7.5 ECTS university course.

For example:
* Universities using trimesters, a course on enterprise technologies uses 1 module (4.5 weekly hours for \~ 3 months).

For universities using semesters, a course on enterprise technologies uses 2 modules (4.5 weekly hours for \~ 5 months).


This course is flexible because you can pick the laboratories you wish to complete across modules.
Currently, this course supports Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Umbra but can be easily extended by adding modules.

## I want to create my own materials and contribute to this course
This course is not a finished product and needs contributions. Your contributions are very welcome! üéâüéâ

Note that contributions are not only code! There are a lot of tasks to build a successful open-source course for everyone. Generally, look for [issues tagged with **help-wanted**](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/university-course/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22). You can help to improve this project in the following ways:

1. Extend the course to other enterprise blockchain technologies. This can be done by adding a new Module. Since this course is modular, people, universities, and other learning institutions can build a customized course using various modules.
Examples: Corda, Hyperledger Besu, Hyperledger Cactus, Hyperledger Sawtooth, Hyperledger Iroha, Cosmos, Polkadot, DAML.

2. Visually teach this course (e.g., YouTube tutorials, crash courses, Posters, flyers). You can use these materials for that!

3. Complete the current laboratories, as some labs are not 100% finalized. Some improvement options are present on the [issues page](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/university-course/issues).

4. Help improve the design of the lab guides.

5. Maintaining and disseminating this project. Contributions to disseminate and manage this project are welcome. Please contact Rafael Belchior <rafael.belchior (at) tecnico (dot) ulisboa (dot) pt>.

6. Contribute with technical expertise in the form of small articles, such as this [introduction to the Libra Blockchain](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-libra-blockchain-technical-overview-part-i-5e872b0369c) or this [2020 review on blockchain interoperability](https://medium.com/coinmonks/blockchain-interoperability-in-2020-a-4-minute-review-e9589b1b1808). Such articles can be added to a special module, in which students read and discuss them.

7. Add theory (slides, presentations, small videos) that can be used to complement the labs.

To contribute code, documentation, and others, please check the [contributing guide](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/university-course/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
