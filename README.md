## Course Motivation & Overview

Provide a reliable basis for university students to learn blockchain through Hyperledger Fabric, and, optionally, other Hyperledger technologies.

This course is a 7.5 ECTS master level course that assumes 3 hours of theory per week + 1.5 weeks of practical classes (laboratory) per week. 
This course implements the laboratory clsases.


The course is divided into two modules:   Module I introduces the technology (labs 1-3) and Module II focuses on Hyperledger Fabric (labs 4-8). For universities using trimesters, the course can be separated into the two modules (1 per trimester). 

For universities using semesters, the whole course (labs 1-9) can be taught in that semester.

## At the end of this course I will:
1.  Understand the concepts in which blockchain is based (labs 1 and 2), what is blockchain, and which problems it can solve (lab 3)
2. (optionally) Know how Ethereum and Hyperledger Besu work. I will be able to write simple smart contracts and deploy them on several networks (lab 4)
3. Know Hyperledeger Fabric's components in detail, as well as its architecture and transactional model (labs 5,6,7)
4. Be able to write smart contracts (chaincode) for Hyperledger Fabric, and bootstrap a Hyperledger Fabric network running those contracts (labs 5,6,7)
5. Understand advanced concepts on the area of consensus, using Hyperledger Umbra (labs 8, 9)
