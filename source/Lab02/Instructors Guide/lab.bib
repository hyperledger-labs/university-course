abstract = {Distributed messaging systems form the core of big data streaming, cloud native applications and microservice architecture. With real-time critical applications there is a growing need for well-built messaging platform that is scalable, fault tolerant and has low latency. There are multiple modern messaging systems that have come up in the recent past, all with their own pros and cons. This has become problematic for the industry to decide which messaging system is the most suitable for a specific application. An in-depth study is required to decide which features of a messaging system meet the needs of the application. This survey paper outlines the modern messaging technologies and delves deep on three popular publisher/subscriber systems-Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ and NATS Streaming. The paper provides information about messaging systems, the use cases, similarities and differences of features to facilitate users to make an informed decision and also pave way for future research and development.},

abstract = {exponents is described. The attack makes use of an algorithm based on continued fractions that finds the numerator and denominator of a fraction in polynomial time when a close enough estimate of the fraction is known. The public exponent e and the modulus pq can be used to create an estimate of a fraction that involves the secret exponent d. The algorithm based on continued fractions uses this estimate to discover sufficiently short secret exponents. For a typical case where e < pq, GCD(p - 1, q- 1) is small, and p and q have approximately the same number of bits, this attack will discover secret exponents with up to approximately one-quarter as many bits as the modulus. Ways to combat this attack, ways to improve it, and two open problems are described. This attack poses no threat to the normal case of RSA where the secret exponent is approximately the same size as the modulus. This is because this attack uses information provided by the public exponent and, in the normal case, the public exponent can be chosen almost independently of the modulus. A cryptanalvtic attack on the use of short RSA secret. {\textcopyright} 1990 IEEE},

abstract = {We consider basic notions of security for cryptographic hash functions: collision resistance, preimage resistance, and second-preimage resistance. We give seven different definitions that correspond to these three underlying ideas, and then we work out all of the implications and separations among these seven definitions within the concrete-security, provable-security framework. Because our results are concrete, we can show two types of implications, conventional and provisional, where the strength of the latter depends on the amount of compression achieved by the hash function. We also distinguish two types of separations, conditional and unconditional. When constructing counterexamples for our separations, we are careful to preserve specified hash-function domains and ranges; this rules out some pathological counterexamples and makes the separations more meaningful in practice. Four of our definitions are standard while three appear to be new; some of our relations and separations have appeared, others have not. Here we give a modern treatment that acts to catalog, in one place and with carefully-considered nomenclature, the most basic security notions for cryptographic hash functions.},

abstract = {Domain 3: Security Engineering, represents a large and complex technical domain. The chapter presents key cryptographic concepts of authentication and non-repudiation in addition to confidentiality and integrity, which are concepts presented in many of the domains. Beyond the foundational operations such as substitution and permutation and types of cryptosystems, symmetric, asymmetric, and hashing, this chapter also introduces key modes of operation for symmetric cryptosystems, Electronic Code Book (ECB), Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), Cipher Feedback (CFB), Output Feedback (OFB), and Counter Mode (CTR). The goal of the domain's final section is to ensure that the safety of personnel is a key consideration when considering physical and environmental security. To ensure this safety requires an understanding of common issues that could negatively impact personnel's safety, such as fire, smoke, flood, and toxins, with particular emphasis on smoke and fire detection and suppression. Physical security is the other main focus of this chapter and attention is given to physical access control matters including fences, gates, lights, cameras, locks, mantraps, and guards.},

abstract = {MD5 is one of the most widely used cryptographic hash functions nowadays. It was designed in 1992 as an improvement of MD4, and its security was widely studied since then by several authors. The best known result so far was a semi free-start collision, in which the initial value of the hash function is replaced by a non-standard value, which is the result of the attack. In this paper we present a new powerful attack on MD5 which allows us to find collisions efficiently. We used this attack to find collisions of MD5 in about 15 minutes up to an hour computation time. The attack is a differential attack, which unlike most differential attacks, does not use the exclusive-or as a measure of difference, but instead uses modular integer subtraction as the measure. We call this kind of differential a modular differential. An application of this attack to MD4 can find a collision in less than a fraction of a second. This attack is also applicable to other hash functions, such as RIPEMD and HAVAL. {\textcopyright} International Association for Cryptologic Research 2005.},

abstract = {Raft is a consensus algorithm for managing a replicated log. It produces a result equivalent to (multi-)Paxos, and it is as efficient as Paxos, but its structure is different from Paxos; this makes Raft more understandable than Paxos and also provides a better foundation for building practical systems. In order to enhance understandabil-ity, Raft separates the key elements of consensus, such as leader election, log replication, and safety, and it enforces a stronger degree of coherency to reduce the number of states that must be considered. Results from a user study demonstrate that Raft is easier for students to learn than Paxos. Raft also includes a new mechanism for changing the cluster membership, which uses overlapping majorities to guarantee safety.},

This situation can be expressed abstractly in terms of a group of generals of the Byzantine army camped with their troops around an enemy city. Communicating only by messenger, the generals must agree upon a common battle plan. However, one or more of them may be traitors who will try to confuse the others. The problem is to find an algorithm to ensure that the loyal generals will reach agreement. It is shown that, using only oral messages, this problem is solvable if and only if more than two-thirds of the generals are loyal; so a single traitor can confound two loyal generals. With unforgeable written messages, the problem is solvable for any number of generals and possible traitors. Applications of the solutions to reliable computer systems are then discussed.},
